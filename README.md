# Exploring the Impact of Network Structures and Dynamics on Information Diffusion

This project investigates how the structure and dynamics of social networks influence the way information spreads. By leveraging real-world Twitter data and simulation models, this study aims to uncover key mechanisms behind information diffusion and provide actionable insights for improving reach and engagement in digital communication platforms.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to understand:
- How network topologies (scale-free, random, small-world, etc.) affect the spread of information.
- How the evolution of these networks over time influences the reach and speed of diffusion.
- What network metrics can be used to optimize information dissemination in real-world scenarios.

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Real-world Twitter data was used, filtered by topic and time windows.
- **Network Modeling**: Created and analyzed multiple types of networks such as:
  - **Scale-free networks** (Barabási–Albert model)
  - **Random networks** (Erdős–Rényi model)
  - **Small-world networks** (Watts–Strogatz model)
- **Simulation**: Used SIR-based diffusion models to simulate how information spreads over different structures.
- **Metrics Analyzed**:
  - Centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness)
  - Clustering coefficient
  - Average path length
  - Temporal dynamics and information cascades

## 📂 Files Included
- 📄 **Report**: Contains a detailed explanation of the approach, visualizations, graphs, and conclusions drawn from the experiments.
- 🧠 **Code**: Includes data processing scripts, network construction code, and diffusion model simulations written in Python (or your language).

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Network topology significantly impacts both the **speed** and **reach** of information diffusion.
- Scale-free networks promote faster spread due to the presence of hubs.
- Time-evolving networks reveal critical thresholds where diffusion either amplifies or dies out.
- Proposed a strategy using influencer detection and community targeting to maximize diffusion in sparse or evolving networks.

## 💡 Future Work
- Incorporate more complex diffusion models (e.g., threshold, IC/LT).
- Extend analysis to multi-layer networks (e.g., combining social + communication layers).
- Analyze user sentiment in addition to structural data
